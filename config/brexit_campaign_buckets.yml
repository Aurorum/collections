        If you trade any goods or services with the EU you'll need to get ready for Brexit.

        For example, you need to take action if you:

        For example, you'll need to:

        - check your passport
        - get travel insurance to make sure you are covered for healthcare
        - make sure you have the right driving documents
        - get a health certificate for your pet, as UK pet passports will no longer be valid in the EU (contact your vet at least 4 months before you travel)

        Continuing to live and work in an EU country after Brexit depends on the rules in that country.

        For example, youâ€™ll need to:

        - register or apply for residency
        - check if you are covered for healthcare and register if necessary
        - exchange your UK driving licence for a licence issued by the EU country where you live
        - check your passport

        For example, you should check if you need to apply to the settlement scheme (if you or your family are from the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland).
